The project aims to compute which playlist ,in an array of objects that contain song information, belongs to a given guardian in an object of guardians that have their own genre.

I had to use the map function to generate the prefered playlist based on genre.
I then diplayed each playlist in the DOM.

I struggled to find a more effective way of mapping the playlists.
My approach is ineffective when the list of guardians increase.
